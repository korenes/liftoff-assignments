## Submission Instructions

1.	Overview: In 1-2 paragraphs, provide an “elevator pitch” for your project. This should be a high-level overview of your idea, in non-technical language. What will your app do? What might users find useful about it? Where did the idea come from?

LoadNotification will be used to notify store managers that a load is on its way.  They will have ample time to be ready to receive the shipment.  No more down time for unloading shipments. 
Truck drivers sitting in the truck waiting for staff to unload inventory leads to a lot of downtime. With LoadNotification, downtime can be virtually eliminated allowing for more deliveries to be made.  
The app will allow the truck driver: to login, select the stores for deliveries, select the type of delivery for each store, send an estimated time of arrival to the next store destination; it will also allow the manager of the store: to login, receive notifications of the time of the next delivery and the type of load the store will receive.

2.	Features: List 3-5 features that you will implement in your project. Each feature should have a name and a 1-2 sentence description. 
o	User Login:  Both truck driver and store manager will be able to login.  All access to the site will be restricted to logged-in users.
o	User Input: Users(drivers) will be able to create new loads in the system by entering in a mix of required details(store number, types of loads, estimated time of arrival).
o	Notification: Managers will be able to receive notifications of estimated delivery times and the types of loads that will be received.
